1. substr
basic_string substr (size_type pos = 0, size_type len = npos) const;
he substring is the portion of the object that starts at character 
position pos and spans len characters (or until the end of the string, whichever comes first).

2. string does not have reverse method. so use algorithm
reverse(str.begin(),str.end());

3. concanate string

First of all, you can do the +sn thing just fine. Though it's going to take exponential quadradic(see comments) 
time assuming you're using std::basic_string<t> strings on C++03.

You can use the std::basic_string<t>::append in concert with std::basic_string<t>::reserve to concatenate
your string in O(n) time.

EDIT: For example

string a;
//either
a.append(s1).append(s2).append(s3);
//or
a.append("I'm a string!").append("I am another string!");
